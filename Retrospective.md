## Experience

Overall, this was probably the most challenging assignment, which makes sense. There was always some small issue, and when I tried looking for it, I changed something else, then a whole series of bugs occured. I had to look very closely.
For an example, I had the wrong variable names and that somewhat troubled me when I was creating the lists in the for loops. It wasn't until I actually read the error on the web page that I found it.
I did customize a few things, like the styling, fonts, and also customized the task's text in the for loop.
I also looked another thing up on the forum, and why my inserting and deleting wasn't working and used an idea similar to what I saw.

## Known issues or Bugs

Saw the "sanitize input" and did some more research, and all it does is just protect "systems from potential threats" which is probably pretty important. I wasn't sure how to sanitize the input and I didn't want to mess up the code, but there is probably some way to exploit some vunerability with sql injection, but it didn't seem that important to put all effort in to fix (though I did find some articles on stackoverflow)
